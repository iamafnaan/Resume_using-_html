    <h3>Brain tumor classification using CNN</h3>
    <p>
        Front end :  Streamlit | Backend : OpenCv, Tensorflow, Numpy, Keras, sklearn  | Language used : Python
    </p>
    <p>
        Using python libraries like <b>Tensorflow and keras</b> a 2D CNN was built and trained upon a dataset which was taken from kaggle
        and for evaluation metrics <b>Sklearn</b> library was used and using <b>Streamlit</b> library GUI was created and the accuracy 
        which was obtained was 93% and it was calculated using <b>sklearn</b> library.
    </p>
    

    
    <h3>Fake news detection</h3>
    <p>
        Libraries used: Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas  | Language used : Python
    </p>
    <p>

        Built a <b>logistic regression</b> and <b> decision tree classification </b> model to classify the given input as real or fake news.

        Tested and compared both the models for it’s accuracy using metrics function of <b> Sklearn</b> library
